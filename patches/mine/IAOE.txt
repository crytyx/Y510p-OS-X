# _PTS and _WAK in this DSDT tend to manipulate externals
# in the IAOE device.  Some manipulates are protected with
# CondRefOf, and some not.  Because of the unprotected
# references, the IAOE SSDT must be included for sleep to
# work.

# This patch is an attempt to fix _PTS/_WAK such that IAOE is
# not required.

# Use this patch after replacing GFX0 with IGPU

# _PTS fixes
